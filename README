= Radiant Ace Code Editor

Radiant extension to accommodate Ace Code Editor ( http://ace.ajax.org/ )

* Whilst editing files using ACE, hit ctrl+enter to switch between normal and full screen mode!
* Fluid layout that expands edit area to the height of the page, great for portrait displays
* Use my CoffeeScript filter and get syntax highlighted CoffeeScript code!

TODO : Support for multiple editors / tabs, currently switching tabs then refreshing the page works!
